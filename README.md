# OneHeart minecraft datapack
Play minecraft with one heart â™¥ only.

But that's not it:
- Changes to
    - mobs
    - blocks
    - biomes
    - loot tables
- Custom advancements
- Get bonus HP under certain circumstances

Changes make the game either harder or just add random rules. It is intended, that some of these rules might be exploited to change the way the game is played. 

As in the vanilla game, there is no big goal, that you need to achieve, but there are advancements, if you want some challenges.

Use `level-type=default` to make the game easier. The datapack functions with both versions.

The associated resource pack isn't finished yet, but will probably be added to this repository, once it's done.
