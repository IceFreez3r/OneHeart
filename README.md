# OneHeart minecraft datapack
Play minecraft with one heart ♥ only.

But that's not it:
- Changes to
    - mobs
    - blocks
    - biomes
    - loot tables
- Custom advancements
- Get bonus HP under certain circumstances

Changes make the game either harder or just add random rules. It is intended, that some of these rules might be exploited to change the way the game is played. 

As in the vanilla game, there is no big goal, that you need to achieve, but there are advancements, if you want some challenges.

Suggested non-default server.properties settings:
```
difficulty=hard
level-type=amplified
# Unicode hearts in MOTD: ♥♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
motd=\u00A7c\u2665\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661
spawn-protection=0
```
Use `level-type=default` to make the game easier. The datapack functions with every world generation.

## Resource pack
### Singleplayer
Move the resource pack to the resourcepack folder.
### Multiplayer
Either send a copy of it to all players or include it as a default resource pack of the server. Note that in the latter case the resource pack will only start loading, once the player joins the server. Meaning they will stand still without being able to move for a few seconds.
## Easier version
There is an easier version of the pack on the [`easy_mode`](https://github.com/IceFreez3r/OneHeart/tree/easy_mode) branch. It will include some slightly easier variations of some mechanics based on the feedback I get.
